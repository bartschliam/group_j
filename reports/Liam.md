I helped choose the datasets and started working on improving the layout of the data so that we could use them in a useful manner, this meant converting 167 columns into extra rows to be used for our queries.

I contributed to the initial design of the ontology model. Once the design was on it's way I then went on to draft the SPARQL queries. After that I started working on the documentation and the reports.

The strength of my contributions were in my dedication to get things done as well as getting started on the large amount of tasks that we had.

My weaknesses were less than ideal understanding of some material and how to use them in a userful matter for the group project.

Our strength as a group came from our determination to push forward even though we weren't sure of how to proceed at times. Another strength was our ability to organise ourselves during the week to work on the project.

Our weakness as a group was an insuficient understanding of how to apply the course material to our project which led to some obstacles.
