# CS7IS1-202223 Group J Project 

# Description
To design and build an interactive ontology-driven application based on:
- at least TWO open data-sets
- Domain (e.g. Crime, Planning, Health, Finance, etc...)

Any dataset chosen:
- **must not** already have an RDF version published
- Must be **open** public data

# Requirements
1. Define a set of 10 questions that users of the application will be able to answer from the combined data and which are not answerable alone by querying over a single dataset. (Note marks available for uniqueness/novelty of chosen domain)

2. Create an OWL ontology to represent the relevant human readable terms and concepts that span both data-sets.
    - Design classes that could be used to link your datasets (e.g. two datasets about two different car brands could be linked using the class "car")
    - Where possible reuse of existing vocabularies/ontologies that are standard for specific domain
    - Use a light-weight ontology to model extra features needed to answer their particular
    - Remember to validate your ontology questions.
3. Uplift the external data instances using R2RML mappings into your model using reused and your own vocabularies

4. Build a basic query interface to allow you at runtime execute a set of SPARQL queries based on your use case questions

Characteristics of the Ontology:
- Must have at least 10 classes
- Must have at least 10 properties
- Provide cardinalities for properties
- Include at least one example property of each of the following types: symmetric, inverse, transitive
- Reuse from other ontologies and vocabularies as
appropriate
    - Expand existing ontologies with your own classes and properties if necessary
    - Good place to search for ontologies and vocabularies: https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/
